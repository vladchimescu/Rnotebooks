    "A second difference is that the <font color='purple'>DESeqDataSet</font> has an associated *design formula*. The experimental design is specified at the beginning of the analysis, as it will inform many of the **DESeq2** functions how to treat the samples in the analysis (one exception is the size factor estimation, i.e., the adjustment for differing library sizes, which does not depend on the design formula). The design formula tells which variables in the column metadata table (<font color='green'>colData</font>) specify the experimental design and how these factors should be used in the analysis.\n",

    "Many common statistical methods for exploratory analysis of multidimensional data, especially methods for clustering and ordination (e.g., principal-component analysis and the like), work best for (at least approximately) homoskedastic data; this means that the variance of an observed quantity (here, the expression strength of a gene) does not depend on the mean. In RNA-Seq data, however, variance grows with the mean. For example, if one performs PCA (principal components analysis) directly on a matrix of normalized read counts, the result typically depends only on the few most strongly expressed genes because they show the largest absolute differences between samples. A simple and often used strategy to avoid this is to take the logarithm of the normalized count values plus a small pseudocount; however, now the genes with low counts tend to dominate the results because, due to the strong Poisson noise inherent to small count values, they show the strongest relative differences between samples.\n",

For genes with high counts, the rlog transformation differs not much from an ordinary log2 transformation. For genes with lower counts, however, the values are shrunken towards the genes’ averages across all samples. Using an empirical Bayesian prior on inter-sample differences in the form of a ridge penalty, this is done such that the rlog-transformed data are approximately homoskedastic. See the help for <font face='courier'>?rlog</font> for more information and options. Another transformation, the *variance stabilizing transformation*, is discussed alongside the <font face='courier'>rlog</font> in the **DESeq2** vignette.\n",
